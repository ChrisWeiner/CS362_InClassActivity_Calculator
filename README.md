# CS362_InClassActivity_Calculator
For CS 362: Software Engineering II, a github repo for the in-class activity for week 5

This is a simple calculator program that takes in a user input for values and operation, and returns a result.
The testing module uses a version of the calculator that does not have user input, and only tests the functions.
